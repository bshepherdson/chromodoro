# Chromodoro - Pomodoro Technique for Chrome

This is a pre-alpha implementation of a Chrome App v2 for tracking your time using the Pomodoro Technique.

The Pomodoro Technique is a trademark owned by Francesco Cirillo. I have no claim to the system, I just wrote some software to help myself keep track of my own use of it.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

It's a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. I won't offer a tutorial or overview here, instead see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and [the homepage](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/).


## Why Chromodoro?

I started writing Chromodoro for two, tangential and unrelated reasons. First, I wanted to use the technique, and couldn't find any apps for it that were all of:

- Easy to use
- Flexible (can add a pomodoro to a task if you forgot to hit start, for example)
- Configurable (why can't I control the lengths of the periods, or the frequency of long breaks?)
- Cross-platform (I want it to run on my Mac and my Android phone)

and so I decided to write one that was.

Second, I work on the [Mobile Chrome Apps](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/chrome-cordova) team at Google, and we've been encouraged to write sample apps. So this is my sample app, and intended to be a case study in how to set out to write a Chrome app that will run with no changes to the code on mobile devices and desktop Chrome.

## How do I use it?

You're on your own for now, it's still under heavy development and its use is discouraged.

## Technology

AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap, Yeoman, Chrome Apps v2. An AppEngine server is planned eventually.
